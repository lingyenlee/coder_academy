# * What’s the weather:
#   * Create a file called whats_the_weather.rb
#   * Inside, create a variable called is_raining
#   * Store a boolean value in is_raining
#   * Use conditionals to say:
#     * “Bring an umbrella” if it’s raining
#     * “Grab your sunglasses” if it’s not raining

is_raining  = true

if is_raining
    puts "Bring an umbrella"
