# Imagine you’re a developer for Nintendo working on the next Pokemon game. 
# Build a class that models a pokemon.
# *For each pokemon we want to keep track of the following attributes:
# - Name
# - Element Type
# - Xp
# We’ll also want to be able to calculate the pokemon’s level, attack and defense statistics 
# which will all be based on the pokemon’s current XP.
# - Pokemon starts at lv 1, and gains a level every 100xp
# - Pokemon’s attack starts at 10 and multiplies by 3 for each level
# - Pokemon’s defense starts at 7 and multiplies by 4 for each level
